My name is Taiga. I&#39;m looking for an adventurous family (all members 14 and up) to join and start making memories. I may be mature in age, but I am young at heart and am as goofy as can be. Being a husky, I have personality characteristics that are adored by many, but can be a challenge for others. I&#39;m looking for someone who has experience with and appreciates these husky characteristics. For example, in typical husky fashion I am vocal when I&#39;m happy to see you, or when I am excited to go for a walk... essentially when I have something to tell you I don&#39;t hold back! For this reason a detached home is ideal so that I don&#39;t disturb neighbours. Also in typical husky fashion, I like - no wait - I LOVE to run. and RUN! I have an adventurous streak and given the opportunity, I will dash off and run with pure joy. Because of this, being off-leash, or even having a door left open will result in you watching my hind end disappear into the distance. When I run there is no stopping me! I&#39;d love a safe outlet for my love of running, such as a jogging partner, a very secure fenced in yard, or maybe even sports like sledding or skijoring. I&#39;m looking forward to training classes to help bond with my new family.Speaking of bonding, one of my favourite ways to spend time with my people is by cuddling. I absolutely love a good snuggle! If you&#39;re looking for a social, energetic, happy girl to accompany you in your active life, please ask to meet me today!

Cuteness overload. We can&#39;t say enough good things about our Carmel.  She is such a sweet and precious girl.

You wouldn&#39;t believe she is 10 years old - she has such a bounce in her step and loves to run and play. She loves her walks and is a very social girl.

Caramel is currently in foster care and is settling in wonderfully.  She loves to hang out with her foster family and is very chilled out and relaxed.  She is excellent with the dog household cat residents.  She is not a barker.

Caramel is being treated for low thyroid which requires 2 pills twice a day.  

Her forever home must have a fully fenced in secure back yard. 
A home where she is the only dog would be best and children who are over the age of 14 years.

Please contact us at deannaaarfrescue@yahoo.ca if you would like to make Carmel a member of your family.

I am a 12 year old boy, but don&#39;t let my age fool you, I am a very active boy. I have been working out every day to get in shape for my new family, I was a little on the chunky side when I arrived at the shelter, it was probably all those treats I was getting. But I have already lost some weigh and the diet I am on will help me lose some more. I think I am looking great if I do say so myself.
A very sad thing happened to me before I came to the shelter, my best friend died and left me behind. I was very sad and confused and lashed out at people who tried to help me. I understand now and I am doing much better, I was really sad and didn&#39;t want people around me, but that is over now. Now I really like people and my tail wags again and it feels so good. I am glad I am happy now.
I am looking for a quiet, adult only home that I can finally retire in and people that I can call my family. Is that you???
So if you are looking for a sexy senior, come and check me out. I will be waiting.

Cujo definitely doesn&#39;t suit his name. He&#39;s a sweet, happy, gentle guy. He would like to be adopted into a calm and quite home that is routine and stable. 
He wants to be spoiled rotten. 
Cujo has some arthritis in his legs which is typical for his age, but he still can move around well. He really wanted to play with the dog in the next run and trotted up and down the fence. 

Cujo must go to a home with no kids under 5. He enjoys his peace and quiet. smile emoticon

Cujo was surrendered to our shelter.

&quot;Jujo, as he is affectionately known by his foster family and me, is doing amazingly well. He is happier, gets along with all the humans and animals in the house and is trotting around like a little boy now that he is on pain meds. Jujo is loving, affectionate and quite a happy fellow and will make an amazing companion for the family who would like offer him a forever home. So if you would like to meet Jujo, please email us at rescuegroup@lchs.ca so we can set up a meeting.&quot;

 Old man Wylie, what can we say? This handsome man is a striking 14 years old and still has pep in his step! Wylie was rescued from a shelter after being taken from his owners during a cruelty investigation. Poor Wylie sat in a kennel, skin and bones with a flea infestation that made his fur fall out in chunks. 

 See his original post here:

 Once he was able to be released he was placed into a lovely foster home where he received lots and lots of TLC (and a good bath!). 

 Wylie is currently living with a small, female dog and loves her to bits. He loves going to the park to run and play (for short periods of time) and is great with people. Wylie likes his evening walkies and basking in the sun. He sleeps well and is completely house broken and fine left alone. 

 We would like to thank Tanya from TDF Photography for her amazing photos of our senior boy. Please show Tanya your support and give her page a LIKE:

 We are seeking a forever home for Wylie where he can continue to get spoiled because he deserves nothing less! A home with no children under 10 years old is best.
